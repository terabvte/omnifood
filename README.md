# Omnifood
## What is this?
This is my attempt at "[Omnifood](https://omnifood-tera.netlify.app/)" a major project on a HTML/CSS course.
### What I learned
- Working with modern layouts using the following:
  * CSS Grid, a **LOT** of CSS Grid like reusable grids and such.
  * Flexbox, for navbar and centering.
- Learn about various modern website design rules
- More advanced styling with CSS (z-index, rem units, forms, semantic HTML, and more...)
- Responsive web design
- A very subtle introduction to Javascript
- ...and [more](https://github.com/terabvte/omnifood/commits/main)
## Notes
For what it's worth, this is only a 1:1 replica of what [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) course asked me to do, so it's not exactly stellar as it lacks originality, but still, this isn't too bad as I might change it in the future to improve it with my own ideas.
